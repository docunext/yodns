YoDNS is a command-line sub-component of YoDNSConf, a web-based dns management system built on Ruby on Rails.

## Plans

I might merge yodns into yodnsconf at some point, but for now I will keep them separate. This gem is meant to be very tiny.

## Example Usage

<pre>
bin/yodns list yodnsconf.com
</pre>
